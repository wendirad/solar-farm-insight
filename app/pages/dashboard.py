    A project analyzes solar farm data from dataset to identify trends in
    solar radiation, temperature, and wind conditions. It includes
    statistical calculations, data quality checks, and visualizations to
    evaluate operational factors such as cleaning efficiency. The objective
    is to provide actionable insights to improve solar energy performance
    and operational sustainability.
